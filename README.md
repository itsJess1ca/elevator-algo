# Elevator Logic
---
Small logic puzzle test.
Simulate a building of elevators able to receive calls to floors, and move on a timer.

## Project
A console based simulator for building elevators. Can simulate multiple buildings with a dynamic amount of floors/elevators.
Works on a tick basis, with the "buildingManager" class housing all timing and rendering logic.

## Demo
```shell
npm run start:demo
```
